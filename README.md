<h1>Web Structure and buttons  </h1>
<p> The structure of this site is very linear you go from page 1 to page 3 with the next button.
Even though this site is linear does not mean that the user must go through it one at a time the user can go back to homepage 
with the back button they can also insert text in the favorite music category.
They will also be able to save their entries in to a local storage save and may even clear their fields.

<p>
The purpose of this site was to show off my favorite songs and also allows the user to add their own personal favorites.
